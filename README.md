# scripts-js
my javascript scripts i use in some projects :)

03/05/2019 - calculate month and year, comparing actual date and birthday date

03/19/2019 - script to export Firestore data, take some time to figure it out how to do without upgrading the project plan.

I have some problems with: special characters, timestamp showing as [Object] and subcollection showing as [Object]

Needs this package installed: https://github.com/jloosli/node-firestore-import-export#exporting

Tested and working on W10, using node 10.15.3
